What was the theme you chose?
    - I chose the theme of OutKast.
    
How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?
    - The first tweet is about OutKast. The second tweet is for Andre 3000. The third is Andre and 
    Big Boi's first album together.
    
What are at least 3 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
    1. Parsing trough the json was difficult for me. I had to test each array and build to them 
    as a print statment. I used a online json parser to help me see the parts I need. 
        
    2. I kept getting an error saying "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests_oauthlib'".
        I solved this by adding it to my requirements.txt. Heroku needed it in the file to deploy.
        
    3. The tweets did not show up on the HTML when it was deployed through heroku. I 
        solved it by putting my two python files together. I originally thought I could
        have both but I could only deploy from one.
    
What are known problems, if any, with your project?
    - The whole tweet does not display. 
    
What would you do to improve your project in the future?
    - I would change the css to look nicer.
